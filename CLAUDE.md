# CLAUDE.md

Architecture & convention reference for **Speedora** — an AI video repurposing platform (OpusClip-
style) that turns long videos into short, viral-ready clips automatically.

This file is an **index**. Detailed, current-state documentation lives in [`docs/`](docs/);
this file stays short on purpose so it's cheap to load every session. Historical "how we got
here" narrative for each shipped feature has been distributed into the topic docs below (as
durable facts, not a session-by-session changelog) — check `git log`/PR history if you need the
literal chronology.

## Product summary

Core MVP flow:

```
Upload video → Transcript (ASR) → Auto-clip detection → Caption + Reframe render → Download
```

## Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Frontend | Next.js + TypeScript |
| Backend API | NestJS |
| Database | PostgreSQL via Prisma (`packages/database`) |
| Queue / Cache | Redis + BullMQ |
| Video processing | FFmpeg (separate worker nodes) |
| ASR | Whisper — Groq `whisper-large-v3-turbo` (default, free) or OpenAI `whisper-1` (paid premium) |
| Object storage | S3-compatible — MinIO in dev, Cloudflare R2 in production |

```

`apps/web` and `apps/api` only communicate over HTTP. `apps/worker` has no HTTP server — it only
consumes BullMQ jobs. Every AI analysis capability is a small, independently-testable stateless
package following one architectural pattern — see [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the
pattern itself and its "add a new module" checklist.

## Status

MVP (upload → transcript → auto-clip → caption → download, retry, object storage, Docker/deploy
readiness) is complete and in production.

Everything since the MVP has followed one architectural throughline: the **JSON-contract stateless
module pattern** (`ARCHITECTURE.md`) — proven on a reference module, then used to migrate existing
worker logic, then to add DB audit-trail infrastructure, then proven again on a feature built from
scratch. On top of that pattern sits the **AI Fusion & Multi-Modal Highlight Scoring** initiative:
independent analysis modules for Audio, Scene, Facial, Gesture, OCR, and LLM-derived signals, each
feeding a shared Fusion Engine that produces one explainable `highlightScore` per clip.

High-level state of each major initiative (see the linked docs for what's actually implemented):

- **Editor & rendering features** (Timeline Editor, Smart Reframe/Auto Zoom, caption styling,
  Sentry observability, hook/hashtag generation, Publish Center for YouTube/TikTok/Instagram,
  premium transcription payments, Content Intelligence scoring, Smart Trim/silence removal,
  cross-clip heatmap dashboard, Smart Transitions, Auto B-roll with a 3-provider adapter, B-roll
  normalization, seamless long-video chunking) — all shipped. See `worker.md`, `frontend.md`,
  `backend.md`.
- **JSON-contract module pattern** — established, applied to every existing worker module, proven
  on state-machine audit-trail infra and on a feature built from scratch. See `ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- **Audio / Scene / Facial Intelligence** (Checkpoint 1) — done. **Mini Fusion Engine v1 → v2 →
  v2.1** — done (weighted feature-level fusion, confidence, explainability, ranking, LLM signal,
  prediction/recommendation). See `ai/fusion.md`.
- **Gesture Intelligence, Face Intelligence (5 batches, 23 sub-features), Scene Intelligence
  taxonomy (cut classification, motion energy, directional camera motion, plus the derived-only
  Motion Intelligence batches SC-4 through SC-7 — Motion Direction, Peak Detection, Complexity,
  Smoothness/Camera Jitter)** — done, all wired into the Fusion Engine at weight 0 pending
  calibration. See `ai/vision.md`.
- **OCR Intelligence** (detection → tracking/classification → evaluation tooling → dataset
  annotation UI) — done through OCR-2.5, wired into the Fusion Engine at a real 10% weight. OCR-3
  (object detector) and OCR-4 (scene understanding) are deferred pending a real annotated dataset.
  See `ai/ocr.md`.
- **Object Intelligence roadmap** (per-entity detection/tracking/behavioral features — people,
  vehicles, products, animals) — a separate package from Scene Intelligence, **complete** (OI-1
  through OI-5, closing out the originally-scoped 10-feature taxonomy). Batch OI-1 (Foundation:
  MediaPipe Object Detector + a genuinely multi-object tracker generalizing OCR Intelligence's
  tracker), OI-2 (motion speed/direction, reusing Scene Intelligence's `CameraMotionDirectionType`),
  OI-3 (occlusion — the first OI feature comparing detections across the same frame, not just
  across time), OI-4 (interaction, exposed as `interactionConfidence` — a 3-component composite of
  proximity/temporal co-presence/distance trend, explicitly named to avoid implying real
  interaction detection this pipeline has no depth/pose/action recognition to support), and OI-5
  (`objectAttentionScore` — not a flat average but a "domain of domains" composite of Visibility/
  Activity/Social sub-scores, mirroring the top-level Fusion Engine's own layered shape one level
  down, plus a separate `objectAttentionConfidence` reliability signal mirroring Speaker
  Intelligence's confidence-score pattern) are all done, wired into the Fusion Engine at weight 0.
  See `ai/object-intelligence.md`.
- **Editing Rhythm** (tempo/pacing/acceleration, a composite signal built from other signals'
  already-computed features) — done, wired at a heuristic (unvalidated) 5% weight since production
  has 0 usable samples to calibrate against yet (`apps/worker/src/scripts/
  check-calibration-coverage.ts` is the reusable check — rerun it as production data accumulates).
  See `ai/fusion.md`.
- **Speaker Intelligence roadmap** (VAD, Active Speaker Detection, Face-Voice Association, Lip
  Sync Verification, Speaker Timeline, Speaker Quality/Confidence/Importance/Engagement/
  Attention/Highlight scoring, Conversation Type Classification) — **this doc's "contracts only,
  no detectors/wiring built yet" status is stale** (confirmed while wiring Composition
  Intelligence's Primary Subject Selection, which consumes Active Speaker Detection's real output
  directly): `packages/active-speaker-intelligence` (`detectActiveSpeaker`,
  `associateSpeakersWithFaces`, `verifyLipSync`) and `packages/speaker-scoring`
  (confidence/engagement/importance/highlight scoring) are fully implemented and already wired into
  `render-clip.worker.ts` and the Fusion Engine (`speaker` key, weight 0). A full re-audit of
  exactly which roadmap items are done vs. still contracts-only hasn't been done — treat this bullet
  and `ai/speaker-intelligence.md` as needing a refresh pass, not as accurate today.
- **Composition Intelligence roadmap** (rule of thirds, headroom, lead room, centering, composition
  stability, framing consistency, subject loss ratio) — a reclassification of an earlier proposed
  15-batch "Camera Intelligence" subsystem, most of which turned out to already be Scene/Motion/
  Object Intelligence under a camera-flavored name. **Complete**: the contract
  (`packages/contracts/src/composition-intelligence.ts`), the derive-function package
  (`packages/composition-intelligence`), a standalone, deliberately non-composition-specific
  Primary Subject Selection package (`packages/primary-subject` — reusable by a future Thumbnail
  Intelligence/Reframe/Multi-Subject initiative, not buried as a private detail of this one), the
  `render-clip.worker.ts` adapter, and Fusion Engine wiring (a new `composition` key, weight 0) are
  all done. See `ai/composition-intelligence.md`.
- **Open**: real dissolve-transition detection, Eye Contact/Gesture/OCR/Composition/etc. weight
  calibration against real engagement data, pitch/F0 audio tracking, a Speaker Intelligence
  re-audit (see above), Video Quality Intelligence (focus/exposure/noise/compression — a separate,
  not-yet-scoped roadmap explicitly split out of Composition Intelligence), and the eventual
  Multi-Modal Fusion Engine (whether it enriches `clip-scoring`'s LLM-selected candidates or
  replaces selection with a continuous importance timeline is an explicit open architectural
  question — see `ai/fusion.md`).

For new feature work: check whether it's an extension of an existing signal/module first (extend,
don't rebuild — this has been an explicit recurring instruction across the AI Fusion roadmap), and
follow the JSON-contract checklist in `ARCHITECTURE.md` for anything new.
