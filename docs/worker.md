# Worker (`apps/worker`)

BullMQ job consumer. No HTTP server. Reads/writes Postgres directly via `@speedora/database`,
reads/writes object storage via `@speedora/storage`, shells out to `ffmpeg`/Python subprocesses for
CV/audio work. See `queue.md` for job orchestration and `coding-standards.md` for the JSON-contract
adapter pattern every AI module here follows.

## Job handlers (`src/workers/*.worker.ts`)

- **`import-youtube`** — downloads via `yt-dlp` (`src/youtube.ts`, `spawn` with
  `--progress-template` streamed line-by-line for real progress, prefers H.264/AAC over AV1 for
  browser compatibility), uploads to `videos/<videoId>.mp4`, self-chains `transcribe`.
- **`transcribe`** — downloads source straight from object storage into Whisper (no local disk for
  this stage), writes `TranscriptSegment` rows with word-level timestamps, runs Diarization +
  Vocal Emotion + Audio Intelligence on the full audio track (see `ai/audio.md`), self-chains
  `detect-clips`. Handles long videos via overlapping chunk extraction + nominal-ownership
  filtering at chunk boundaries so no word is ever split across a chunk seam.
- **`detect-clips`** — one LLM call (`packages/clip-scoring`) over the full transcript selects 1–3
  candidate clips with `ClipScores`, `hookText`, `hashtags`, emoji suggestions (see `ai/llm.md`).
  Self-chains one `render-clip` per candidate.
- **`render-clip`** — the biggest handler; see below. Also the re-render target for the Timeline
  Editor's explicit "Render" button (same job, same code path, not a special case).
- **`publish-clip`** — uploads a rendered clip to the target platform (see `backend.md`'s Publish
  Center). The only job with BullMQ's built-in retry (`attempts: 3`, exponential backoff) — every
  other job fails once and waits for a manual retry, because a platform API's transient failures
  are the one class of error this pipeline treats as not needing user judgment.
- **`schedule-publish-clip`** (repeatable, 60s poll) and **`sync-publish-stats`** (repeatable, 6h)
  — see `backend.md`.

## `render-clip` pipeline (in order)

1. **Face detection + reframe plan** (`@speedora/reframe`) — MediaPipe Face Detector via a Python
   subprocess, ~1 sample/sec. Builds a crop path (position from face tracking, size from an
   emphasis-word-triggered zoom envelope — "Auto Zoom") interpolated into an FFmpeg `sendcmd`
   script. Falls back to a static center-crop if no face is found anywhere in the clip, or if the
   subprocess fails for *any* reason — face detection failure never fails the render job.
2. **Scene cut detection + classification** (`@speedora/scene-intelligence`) — ffmpeg
   `select='gt(scene,threshold)'`/`showinfo` for cut timestamps, a second `blackdetect` pass to
   classify each cut as `hard_cut`/`fade`/`dissolve` (`dissolve` reserved in the enum, not yet
   produced). Plus `analyzeMotionEnergy()` (ffmpeg `signalstats`, magnitude only, no direction) and
   `detectCameraMotion()` (Python/OpenCV ECC image alignment → pan/tilt/zoom/shake).
3. **Facial + gesture + face-landmark intelligence** (`@speedora/facial-intelligence`,
   `@speedora/gesture-intelligence`) — three separate MediaPipe/transformers Python subprocesses:
   expression classification (`trpakov/vit-face-expression`), hand gesture recognition, and
   FaceLandmarker (blink/smile/mouth-open/head-rotation/eye-contact/lip-activity/face
   tracking+re-identification — see `ai/vision.md` for the full sub-feature breakdown). All three
   are wrapped independently in try/catch — one failing detector never blocks the others or the
   job.
4. **OCR text detection + tracking** (`@speedora/ocr-intelligence`) — Tesseract via `pytesseract`,
   greedy multi-object tracking across samples, rule-based category classification (subtitle/
   slide/caption/logo/price/name). See `ai/ocr.md`.
5. **Editing Rhythm** (`@speedora/editing-rhythm`) — pure/synchronous, combines the already-
   computed `sceneCuts`/`motionEnergy`/aggregate features from steps above into tempo/pacing/
   acceleration scores. Never throws, no try/catch needed.
6. **Fusion Engine** (`@speedora/fusion-engine`) — combines every signal above (plus the LLM's
   `ClipScores` passed through the job payload) into `highlightScore`/`confidence`/
   `explainability`/`prediction`/`recommendation`. See `ai/fusion.md`.
7. **Caption build** (`@speedora/subtitles`) — transcript → ASS/SSA (`buildAss()`), one code path
   for every `CaptionStyle` preset (`DEFAULT`/`KARAOKE`/`BOLD_HIGHLIGHT`).
8. **Silence/filler cut planning** (`@speedora/cutlist`) — word-gap-based silence detection (>0.7s
   gap, 0.15s padding) + a narrow um/uh filler-word list, merged into cut ranges.
9. **FFmpeg render** (`src/ffmpeg.ts`) — crop/zoom filter (from step 1's `sendcmd` script) → B-roll
   overlay (if any keyword moments matched, `-filter_complex` only when B-roll is present) →
   subtitle burn-in. A **second** FFmpeg pass then applies the cutlist from step 8
   (`select`/`aselect` + `setpts`/`asetpts`) over the *rendered* output — captions/crop are already
   burned in clip-relative coordinates, so trimming afterward automatically removes the right
   pixels without any separate time-remap logic. A dip-to-black micro-transition (`eq` filter,
   brightness dips at each cut junction — not `fade`, which has a real chaining bug in this
   project's ffmpeg build that blacks out the whole output) softens the resulting jump cuts.
10. **Upload + persist** — one `prisma.clip.update()` writes every raw/derived field from every
    step above.
11. **Ranking** — once every sibling clip in the video has finished rendering (`allRendered`),
    `rankClips()` re-scores the whole set and writes `highlightRank` per clip, in its own try/catch
    so a ranking failure never undoes an otherwise-successful render.

## Smart Reframe / Auto Zoom

See `ai/vision.md` for the model/algorithm details. Architecturally: crop *position* (x/y) comes
from face tracking, crop *size* (w/h) comes from an independent "emphasis word" zoom envelope
(attack/hold/release) — either signal alone is enough to produce a path; both null only when
neither a face nor an emphasis word was found anywhere in the clip. `ReframeOptions` separates the
instant crop dimensions from the final encoded output dimensions (`outputWidth`/`outputHeight`) —
a `scale` filter after `crop` in the FFmpeg filtergraph keeps the encoded resolution constant even
while the crop window itself shrinks during a zoom.

## Caption styling

`Clip.captionStyle` (`DEFAULT`/`KARAOKE`/`BOLD_HIGHLIGHT`) drives `buildAss()`. `KARAOKE` uses
native ASS `\k` tags (needs `TranscriptSegment.words`, falls back to plain text for
pre-word-timestamp segments). `BOLD_HIGHLIGHT` uses a keyword heuristic (numbers/percentages,
ALL-CAPS, quoted phrases) inline via `{\b1\c...}` override tags — no word-timestamp dependency, so
it works on any transcript.

## B-roll

`@speedora/broll` + an adapter-pattern provider layer (Pexels/Pixabay/Unsplash, tiered:
video providers first, photo fallback second) behind a single `StockAssetService`/`AssetProvider`
interface — `ffmpeg.ts` only ever sees a normalized `StockAsset {url, type: 'video'|'image', ...}`,
never a provider-specific shape. Cutaways are composited via two FFmpeg passes through a
`qtrle`/`.mov` intermediate (the only codec in this pipeline that carries an alpha channel for the
fade) because this project's ffmpeg build corrupts output when two `fade` filter instances are
chained in one pass. Normalized to a fixed FPS/color space (bt709/tv range) before compositing so
cutaways from different providers don't visibly jump in framerate or tint.

## Docker image (`apps/worker/Dockerfile`)

`node:20-slim` (Debian/glibc), not Alpine — MediaPipe's PyPI wheels have no musl build at all.
Installs: `ffmpeg`, `python3` + `mediapipe`/`opencv-python-headless`/`transformers`/`torch`/
`torchaudio`/`pyannote.audio`/`soundfile`/`scipy` (`--break-system-packages`, PEP 668), plus
`tesseract-ocr`/`tesseract-ocr-eng` + `pytesseract` for OCR. Model files (`.tflite`/`.task`,
gitignored, downloaded via `curl` — see `../README.md`) are baked into the image at build time,
not fetched at runtime. `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN` is read directly from the environment by the Python
scripts, never passed as a CLI arg (keeps it out of process listings/argv logs).
