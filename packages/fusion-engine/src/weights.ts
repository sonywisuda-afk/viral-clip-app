import type { FusionWeights } from '@speedora/contracts';

// Default per-signal weights - explicit values given by the user, sized so
// audio/scene/facial/ocr/llm sum to exactly 1.0. Injectable (see
// computeHighlightScore's `weights` parameter): Checkpoint 5 of the AI
// Fusion roadmap ("Training, Weight Optimization") is expected to replace
// this table with values learned from real engagement data, not hardcode
// forever.
//
// `sceneMotion` (Scene Intelligence taxonomy expansion, Batch SC-2) is also
// deliberately 0, same reasoning as gesture/faceGeometry below - motion-
// energy/static-dynamic classification is brand new and unvalidated, and
// `scene` itself already carries a real weight, so `sceneMotion` stays
// separate and silent until there's data to justify a non-zero value.
// `cameraMotion` (Batch SC-3, directional pan/tilt/zoom/shake) is the same
// story one batch later - collected and visible in `contributions` for
// calibration, contributing nothing to highlightScore yet.
// `editingRhythm` (taxonomy category F - tempo/pacing/acceleration,
// composed from scene/sceneMotion/audio's own already-computed features)
// gets the identical treatment, per explicit user direction: wire it in
// now, gather real data, evaluate the distribution, THEN calibrate.
//
// `gesture`/`faceGeometry` are deliberately 0 here, not absent - both are
// collected (raw + derived features both exist, see
// @speedora/gesture-intelligence and @speedora/facial-intelligence's
// detectFaceLandmarks) and still show up in `contributions` for
// transparency/future calibration, but don't move highlightScore yet. Same
// "low standalone value until calibrated against real data" reasoning
// gesture already carries - `faceGeometry` (blink/smile/mouth-open/head-
// rotation/framing, AI Fusion roadmap's Face Intelligence initiative Batch
// 1) is new enough that giving it a nonzero weight ahead of any real
// engagement-data validation would just be another unvalidated guess
// layered on top of the ones already acknowledged in this table's own
// history (see the fusion-engine v2/v2.1 sections in CLAUDE.md).
//
// `ocr` was a reserved key with no corresponding fusionInputSchema field
// (no module produced those features) until the AI Fusion roadmap's OCR
// initiative's Batch OCR-2 - it now has a real contribution too, same as
// `llm` (Fase 32) - see feature-pipeline.ts's extractOcrFeatures/
// extractLlmFeatures. The 0.1 weight below is the SAME value given by the
// user back in Fase 31, before any OCR module existed to fill it -
// unvalidated against real engagement data now just as it was reserved
// unvalidated then.
