// into per-connection subscribe/unsubscribe lifecycle management, for no
// real benefit at this app's scale. Lives here (not packages/shared) since
// packages/database is the one package already shared between apps/api and
// apps/worker for notification concerns - the browser never needs this
// constant/type, it only receives a JSON payload over SSE and treats it as
// an opaque "something changed, refetch" signal.

// Deliberately id-only (same "DB row is truth" convention as every other
// job payload in this codebase) rather than carrying channel/preference
// details - the notification-delivery worker resolves "which channels are
// actually enabled + configured for this user/type" itself at process time,
// keeping this function's own contract (and every existing call site) fully
// unaware of SLACK/DISCORD/WEBHOOK specifics.
export type EnqueueDeliveryFn = (event: { notificationId: string }) => void | Promise<void>;

// Inserts one Notification row - see schema.prisma's own comment on why this
// is a separate model from ActivityEvent. Same shape/posture as
// recordActivityEvent: takes any Prisma client-shaped object (a real
// PrismaClient, or a `tx`), never catches/logs on its own - that's the
// caller's job (wrap in .catch(logger.warn) or console.warn), same "never
// let a secondary/notification write break the primary action" discipline
// as every recordActivityEvent call site.
//
// Sprint 4B - gated by NotificationPreference's IN_APP row before writing.
// Absence of a preference row = enabled (default-on), same convention the
// rest of this feature uses. Disabling IN_APP naturally also suppresses any
// toast for this type (see schema.prisma's NotificationPreference comment) -
// nothing is ever created for NotificationBell's poll to notice.
//
// Milestone 04c - `deps.publish` is an OPTIONAL injected capability, same
// "stateless module takes an injected external dependency" shape as
// packages/reframe's DetectFacesDeps (this package stays Redis-agnostic;
// apps/api/apps/worker each supply their own real Redis-backed publisher).
// Optional (not required) so every existing call site keeps working
// unchanged until deliberately updated to pass one. A publish failure is
// caught HERE, not left to the caller's own .catch() - a DB write failure
// is a real problem (the notification wasn't recorded); a publish failure
// just means the realtime nudge didn't go out, which is exactly what the
// polling fallback exists to cover. These must never be conflated into the
// same log line/severity.
