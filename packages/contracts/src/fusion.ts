// Defined ahead of the modules that produce every input (per explicit user
// direction) - every signal module built from here on (Eye Contact, Visual
// Intelligence, OCR, LLM/semantic) is expected to plug its own `features`
// object into this contract as an additional optional field, the same way
// audio/scene/facial/gesture already do below. Checkpoints EXTEND this
// contract and the engine that reads it (packages/fusion-engine), they
// never replace either.
//
// v2 (Fase 31) - revised per explicit user architectural direction after
// v1 (Fase 29) shipped: (1) weighted, not averaged, scoring so each
// signal's contribution is independently tunable and later optimizable
// against real engagement data (Checkpoint 5 in the roadmap diagram);
// (2) `confidence` and structured `explainability` as first-class output,
// not just a single opaque number + one sentence; (3) FEATURE-level fusion
// - the engine extracts/normalizes/weights individual named features
// (e.g. audio's averageRmsDb AND speakingRateStdDev separately), not one
// pre-collapsed per-module score - so adding a new module later contributes
// richer information without any existing detail being lost.
// `faceGeometry` (AI Fusion roadmap's Face Intelligence initiative, Batch 1) -
// blink/smile/mouth-open/head-rotation/framing signals from MediaPipe's
// FaceLandmarker, distinct from `facial` (expression classification via a
// separate ViT model) - the two run as separate subprocess calls producing
// unrelated feature sets, so they're separate signals here too, not folded
// together.
// `sceneMotion` (Scene Intelligence taxonomy expansion, Batch SC-2) -
// motion-energy/static-dynamic classification, a SEPARATE signal from
// `scene`'s cut-based features: a clip can be one continuous shot (zero
// cuts) yet still be highly dynamic, or full of cuts between static shots.
// Deliberately its own signal rather than folded into `scene`'s features -
// `scene` already carries a real, non-zero weight (30%, see weights.ts), so
// adding an uncalibrated new feature into it would immediately shift every
// existing clip's highlightScore with no data backing the change. Same
// "weight 0 until calibrated" treatment as gesture/faceGeometry below.
// `cameraMotion` (Scene Intelligence taxonomy expansion, Batch SC-3) -
// directional camera motion (pan/tilt/zoom/shake), a SEPARATE signal from
// `sceneMotion`'s magnitude-only measurement above - same "collected, weight
// 0 until calibrated" treatment, per explicit user direction: wire it into
// the pipeline now, gather real data, evaluate the distribution, THEN
// calibrate before it's allowed to move highlightScore.
// `editingRhythm` (taxonomy category F, requested by user after Scene
// Intelligence Batch SC-3) - a COMPOSITE signal, not a raw detector: its
// own module (@speedora/editing-rhythm) combines OTHER signals'
// already-computed output (scene/sceneMotion/audio) into tempoScore/
// pacingScore/accelerationScore. Per explicit user architectural rule:
// composite/derived signals like this one get their own package and are
// wired into the Fusion Engine exactly like a raw-detection signal -
// weight 0 until calibrated, same "collect first, calibrate later"
// treatment as sceneMotion/cameraMotion/gesture/faceGeometry. The Fusion
// Engine itself never derives new features - it only ever combines/weighs
// whatever `*Features` objects already exist.
