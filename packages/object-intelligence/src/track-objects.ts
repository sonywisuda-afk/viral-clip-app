// already exist upfront, no reason to duplicate tracking logic inside the
// subprocess" reasoning as @speedora/ocr-intelligence's trackOcrText()
// (Batch OCR-2), which this module directly generalizes.
//
// Genuinely MULTI-object from the start (N active tracks vs. M per-frame
// detections, greedy lowest-cost-first assignment) - unlike Face
// Intelligence Batch 4's FaceTracker, which only ever tracks the single
// most prominent face (a real-time Kalman filter + a literal 1x1 Hungarian
// assignment). A frame here can have many simultaneous objects, the same
// reason OCR's tracker (not Face's) is the right precedent.
//
// The one real difference from trackOcrText()'s cost function: `category`
// is a HARD gate here, not a weighted cost term - a "car" detection must
// never merge into a "person" track. IoU alone decides the match cost among
// same-category candidates, since there's no text-similarity analog to
// blend in.
