# Registers a Windows Scheduled Task that runs start.ps1 automatically at
# user logon, so a machine reboot doesn't silently leave apps/api and
# apps/worker down until someone remembers to run start.ps1 by hand.
#
# Deliberately triggered AtLogOn for the current user, not AtStartup as
# SYSTEM - AtStartup runs before any user profile loads and under a SYSTEM
# account whose PATH/environment doesn't necessarily have node/pnpm set up
# the way an interactive login shell does; AtLogOn for this user matches the
# environment start.ps1/watchdog.ps1 are actually meant to run in, and
# doesn't require elevation to register.
#
# Usage: powershell -File .dev-scripts\install-autostart.ps1
# Remove: powershell -File .dev-scripts\uninstall-autostart.ps1
# Check:  powershell -File .dev-scripts\status.ps1 (reports registered or not)
