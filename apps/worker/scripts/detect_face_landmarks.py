AI Fusion roadmap - Face Intelligence initiative, Batch 1 (+ Batch 2's iris
points, Batch 3's image-quality/occlusion metrics - all the same subprocess
call). Samples frames from a clip's time range, runs MediaPipe's
FaceLandmarker Task (468 face-mesh points + 10 iris points + 52 blendshape
scores + a facial transformation matrix per detected face) on each one,
crops the face region from the SAME already-read frame for a few pixel-
level OpenCV measurements, and prints a JSON array to stdout:

  [{
    "t": <seconds from clip start>,
    "blendshapes": {"eyeBlinkLeft", "eyeBlinkRight", "mouthSmileLeft",
                     "mouthSmileRight", "jawOpen"} | null,
    "rotation": {"pitch", "yaw", "roll"} (degrees) | null,
    "boundingBox": {"xCenter", "yCenter", "width", "height"} (normalized) | null,
    "leftIris" / "rightIris": {"x", "y", "z"} | null,
    "leftEyeInnerCorner" / "leftEyeOuterCorner" /
    "rightEyeInnerCorner" / "rightEyeOuterCorner": {"x", "y", "z"} | null,
    "sharpness": <float, raw Laplacian variance> | null,
    "brightness": <float, 0-255 mean grayscale> | null,
    "mouthContrastRatio": <float> | null,
    "faceDescriptor": [<float>, ...] (9 scale-invariant ratios) | null,
    "trackId": <int> | null,
    "mouthWidth": <float, scale-invariant ratio> | null
  }, ...]

null across every field means "no face found in this sampled frame" - same
convention as detect_faces.py/detect_facial_emotion.py, never crashes the
whole process over one bad sample.

Uses the SAME "most prominent face" heuristic as detect_faces.py (Fase 2)
when more than one face is detected in a frame - picked by bounding-box
area derived from the landmark cloud's own min/max extent (FaceLandmarker's
output has no separate detection-confidence bounding box the way
FaceDetector does).

Needs a SEPARATE model file from detect_faces.py's blaze_face_short_range -
FaceLandmarker's own `.task` bundle (not a bare `.tflite`), downloaded from
MediaPipe's model zoo (see apps/worker/README.md for the URL). Passed as a
CLI arg, same "deployment config flows through deps + CLI args" convention
as every other script here.

Landmark indices for eye corners/iris centers below (33/133/362/263 for eye
corners, 468/473 for iris centers) are MediaPipe's own published canonical
Face Mesh indices (stable across the "with attention"/iris-refinement model
variant this script requires) - "left"/"right" is ANATOMICAL (the subject's
own left/right eye, matching MediaPipe's own landmark map naming), not
image-left/image-right.

Head pose (pitch/yaw/roll) is decomposed from FaceLandmarker's own 4x4
facial transformation matrix via the standard XYZ rotation-matrix-to-Euler
decomposition (see rotation_matrix_to_euler_degrees below) - yaw=pitch=
roll=0 means looking straight at the camera.

Batch 3 (Blur/Sharpness/Lighting/Occlusion) - `sharpness` is the Laplacian
variance (cv2.Laplacian(...).var()) of the WHOLE face crop in grayscale, a
standard, widely-used blur-detection measurement (higher = sharper; this
one raw number serves BOTH "Blur Detection" and "Face Sharpness Score" from
the original feature list - they're the same underlying measurement read
in opposite directions, not two separate things to compute).
`brightness` is the crop's mean grayscale pixel value (0-255) - "Face
Lighting Score"'s raw input. `mouthContrastRatio` is the mouth region's OWN
local Laplacian variance divided by the whole-face-crop's variance - a
COARSE occlusion proxy (a hand/object covering the mouth tends to be much
smoother/flatter than the surrounding textured face, producing a low
ratio), NOT a trained occlusion detector; see
deriveFaceLandmarkFeatures's own comment on how this becomes
`occlusionRate`. Mouth region cropped from 4 canonical outer-lip landmark
indices (61/291 corners, 13/14 upper/lower lip).

Batch 4 (Face Re-identification/Tracking, AI Fusion roadmap) - explicit user
architectural direction: strengthen single-object tracking with a Kalman
Filter (motion prediction/smoothing through brief misdetections) + Hungarian
Assignment (scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment, a principled cost-matrix
matching decision) + IoU (bounding-box overlap) + pose consistency (head-
rotation continuity), rather than a plain frame-to-frame threshold. This
project still only detects the SINGLE most prominent face per frame
(num_faces=1 above, unchanged) - there's no multi-face data association
problem to solve here, but the SAME formal cost-matrix + Hungarian-solver
machinery used for real multi-object tracking still adds genuine value in
this single-track case: the Kalman filter coasts the track THROUGH brief
gaps (a frame or two where detection fails) instead of a gap spuriously
looking like "the speaker left and a new one appeared", and the fused
IoU+descriptor+pose cost is a more principled same-track/new-track decision
than a single raw threshold on any one signal alone. See FaceTracker below.
`trackId` (a simple incrementing integer, new track each time the tracker
decides "this is not a continuation") is this script's ONLY new raw output
field for Batch 4 - @speedora/facial-intelligence's deriveFaceLandmarkFeatures
derives speakerChangeCount/dominantSpeakerConsistency from the resulting
sequence of trackIds, and (Speaker Face Selection's "real" version, replacing
Fase 2's plain largest-bounding-box heuristic) speakerAudioSyncRate by
correlating this script's own jawOpen blendshape against the clip's
transcript segments' audio loudness (Fase 25) - that correlation happens in
TypeScript (render-clip.worker.ts already has both in scope at the same
point it calls this script), not here, since this script has no access to
audio/transcript data at all.

The geometric descriptor used for the "appearance" half of the tracking cost
(FACE_DESCRIPTOR_LANDMARKS below) is a set of scale-invariant inter-landmark
distance RATIOS (each divided by inter-ocular distance, the standard face-
geometry normalization unit) - explicitly NOT a trained face-recognition
embedding (see CLAUDE.md's Fase 36 section for why: explicit user direction
to avoid a new heavy ML dependency like dlib/face_recognition). This is a
real accuracy/simplicity trade-off: geometric ratios are far less
discriminative between two similar-looking individuals than a trained
embedding would be, particularly across head-rotation, which is the reason
pose consistency is ALSO folded into the tracking cost (partially
compensating by trusting appearance less when the head has turned a lot
between frames).

Batch 5A (Lip Activity, AI Fusion roadmap) - pure TypeScript derivation from
the existing jawOpen blendshape sequence (averageLipVelocity/
speakingIntensity/pauseCount/articulationRate, see
@speedora/facial-intelligence's deriveFaceLandmarkFeatures) - no changes to
this script at all for that sub-batch.

Batch 5B (Smile & Laugh, AI Fusion roadmap) - user's own split of the
original "Batch 5" plan into 5A/5B/5C/5D. Adds 4 more of MediaPipe's 52
blendshape categories to TRACKED_BLENDSHAPES (cheekSquintLeft/Right,
eyeSquintLeft/Right - the orbicularis-oculi "eye crinkle"/cheek-raise
markers of a GENUINE, "Duchenne" smile, as opposed to a posed one that only
activates the mouth), plus a new raw field `mouthWidth` - corner-to-corner
mouth distance normalized by inter-ocular baseline (mouth_width_ratio()
below), the SAME scale-invariant normalization convention as
face_descriptor()'s ratios, computed as its OWN independent function rather
than reused from inside face_descriptor()'s opaque array (that one is
documented as a tracking-only fingerprint, not meant to be read field-by-
field; mouthWidth here is a genuinely meaningful, independently-named
feature). @speedora/facial-intelligence's deriveFaceLandmarkFeatures derives
averageMouthWidth/averageCheekRaise/averageEyeSquint plus a `genuineSmileRate`
heuristic (fraction of "smiling" samples that ALSO show cheek-raise + eye-
squint) from these - see that module's own honest caveat on why this is a
coarse threshold heuristic, not a trained/validated Duchenne-smile classifier.

Batch 5C (Blink & Eye Behavior, AI Fusion roadmap) - pure TypeScript
derivation from data already collected since Batch 1 (blink blendshapes)
and Batch 2 (iris/eye-corner landmarks) - blinkFrequencyPerMinute/
prolongedClosureCount/gazeStabilityScore, see
@speedora/facial-intelligence's deriveFaceLandmarkFeatures - no changes to
this script at all for that sub-batch either.

Batch 5D (Emotion Heuristic, AI Fusion roadmap) - the last sub-batch of
user's 5A/5B/5C/5D split. Adds 5 more blendshape categories to
TRACKED_BLENDSHAPES (browDownLeft/Right, browInnerUp, browOuterUpLeft/
Right - eyebrow movement, tracked as an undirected MAGNITUDE, not "raised
vs furrowed", per user's own explicit safety requirement below) plus a new
raw field `averageHeadMovementRate` derivation input (this script already
emits `rotation` per sample - no NEW raw field needed here, the head-
movement RATE is computed in TypeScript from the existing rotation
sequence). @speedora/facial-intelligence's deriveFaceLandmarkFeatures
combines Smile (Batch 1/5B) + Jaw/Speaking (Batch 1/5A) + Eyebrow (this
batch) + Head movement (this batch, from existing rotation) into a
`dominantAffect` heuristic label - user's explicit instruction: "Jangan
langsung mengklaim 'sedih' atau 'marah', tetapi gunakan label seperti:
positive affect, high energy, low energy, expressive, neutral" - so the
output vocabulary is deliberately restricted to those 5 safe labels, never
a discrete emotion name, and the whole thing is a simple deterministic
decision tree (not a trained classifier) - see that module's own caveat.

PENDING REAL-MACHINE VERIFICATION: written in a sandbox with neither Python
nor a real video file available, same honest gap as every other MediaPipe-
based script in this pipeline (detect_faces.py/detect_facial_emotion.py/
detect_gestures.py). Specifically unverified before trusting this in
production: (1) that facial_transformation_matrixes' rotation submatrix
actually follows the XYZ convention this decomposition assumes - MediaPipe's
own docs don't spell out the exact Euler convention, only that it's a
right-handed transform matrix; (2) that the eye-corner/iris/mouth/descriptor
landmark indices above are exactly right for THIS model variant (canonical
Face Mesh indices are stable and well-published, but only cross-referenced
against documentation here, never run against a real face); (3) that
mouthContrastRatio's threshold (see the deriving module) actually
distinguishes real occlusion from a closed, naturally-smooth mouth/chin -
the least-confident heuristic in this script; (4) the tracking cost weights/
MATCH_THRESHOLD/MAX_MISSES below (Batch 4) are reasonable starting guesses,
not calibrated against any real multi-speaker footage.
