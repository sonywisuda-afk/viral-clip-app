Batch SC-3 (Scene Intelligence taxonomy expansion, continuing SC-1/SC-2) -
samples frames from a clip's time range (~1/sec, same cadence as
detect_facial_emotion.py/detect_gestures.py/detect_face_landmarks.py) and
estimates the GLOBAL camera transform (translation/scale/rotation) between
each consecutive pair via OpenCV's ECC (Enhanced Correlation Coefficient)
image alignment (cv2.findTransformECC, MOTION_AFFINE). Prints a JSON array
to stdout:

  [{"t": <seconds from clip start>, "dx": <float>|null, "dy": <float>|null,
    "scale": <float>|null, "rotation": <float>|null, "ecc": <float>|null}, ...]

This script computes ONLY the raw per-sample transform - classifying it
into pan/tilt/zoom/shake scores is @speedora/scene-intelligence's
deriveCameraMotionFeatures()'s job (pure TypeScript), per explicit user
design direction (same "raw vs. features" split as every other module in
this pipeline).

Chosen over ffmpeg's vidstabdetect (libvidstab) after an explicit user
decision between the two: libvidstab is an OPTIONAL ffmpeg component whose
availability in this project's ffmpeg build was never verified, and its
transform output goes to a file (not stderr), which would break the
"parse stderr" pattern every other scene-intelligence detector uses.
OpenCV's ECC needs no new Python dependency (cv2/numpy already installed
since Batch 1 Face Landmarker) and is a standard, well-documented API for
exactly this: aligning two images and returning the transform between them.

The first sample (t=0, no previous frame) and any sample where ECC failed
to converge (cv2.error, e.g. insufficient texture/contrast to align on) get
null for every transform field - "null means no signal, not zero", same
convention as detect_facial_emotion.py.

PENDING REAL-MACHINE VERIFICATION: written in a sandbox with neither Python
nor a real video file available - cv2.findTransformECC's convergence
behavior and the warp-matrix decomposition below have NOT been run against
real footage. In particular, whether MOTION_AFFINE's default iteration
count/epsilon (see ECC_CRITERIA below) converges reliably on typical
talking-head/handheld footage (vs. needing more iterations, or falling back
to MOTION_TRANSLATION/MOTION_EUCLIDEAN for speed) is unconfirmed.

Usage: detect_camera_motion.py <video_path> <start_seconds> <end_seconds> <interval_seconds>
